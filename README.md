# Stroke Prediction

## Introduction

We will predict strokes with these data.

Stroke is a medical emergency. A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die within minutes

- Risk factors for having a stroke include

- Age: People aged 55 years and over

- Hypertension: if the systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg or more, or the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or more

- Hypercholesterolemia: If the cholesterol level in the blood is 200 milligrams per deciliter

- Smoking

- Diabetes

- Obesity: if the body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more
